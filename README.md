Coimbatore is one of my favourite places.
I visited the city with my family for my brother’s graduation ceremony. We reached at midnight, and I was already excited to see his college. After breakfast the next morning, we waited for my other brother to arrive, and then we all went to the campus together.

The college was huge, filled with tall trees that made the place feel calm and beautiful. We entered the auditorium, and although the long speeches were a bit boring, everything felt worth it when my brother finally received his degree. We took pictures, shared smiles, and then went for lunch.

Later, we explored the campus again—its massive grounds and large playgrounds made it feel like a world of its own. After the tour, we returned to the hotel, ending the day with happy memories of Coimbatore.

I visited Kanyakumari with my family and relatives when I was studying in 5th standard, and it remains one of my happiest memories. Our first stop was a masjid, where we prayed together in the calm morning air. After that, we went to see the Thiruvalluvar statue. It stood tall and majestic in the middle of the sea, looking both powerful and peaceful at the same time.

I took pictures with my relatives, laughed a lot, and enjoyed my favourite snacks. We even bought more snacks and a few cosmetics from the shops nearby. Suddenly, the sky darkened and it began to rain, soft at first and then heavy. So we hurried to our hotel, carrying the excitement of the day with us.

I visited Kodaikanal when I was in 2nd standard, along with my family and my aunt’s family. I don’t remember everything clearly, but the memories I do have feel soft and warm. The place was freezing, and we wore hoodies the entire time, our breaths turning into tiny clouds in the cold air.

I remember going for a boat ride, then riding a small cycle along the lake. I ate ice cream and hot corn, the perfect mix for the cold weather. We also met one of our relatives there and shared lunch together, laughing and talking as if the mountains were listening.

Later, we went shopping, and I bought plenty of chocolates—more than I could carry. At one point, my uncle asked if I wanted to ride a horse, but I was too scared and said no.

These are the little pieces of Kodaikanal that have stayed with me, like pages from an old, gentle story.

 I visited Ooty with my family when I was in 11th standard. It was a one-day trip, but the journey felt long because I had motion sickness the entire time and couldn’t eat anything. Still, the moment we reached Ooty, the cold air and the green hills made everything feel lighter.

Our first stop was the Rose Garden. I took so many photos there, standing among roses of all colours, as if I had stepped into a painted world. After that, we went to the Botanical Garden, where the paths curved beautifully through the greenery.

Later, we visited the bamboo forest. We walked deeper inside until we found a large, quiet pond hidden in the middle of it. Me and my brother even climbed a tree and took pictures, laughing like we were little kids again. Before leaving, we went shopping—I bought chocolates and picked out small gifts for my friends.

Even with the motion sickness, the trip to Ooty felt like a page from a gentle, green-coloured story.

I visited Kerala with my family and my favourite aunties during my 12th holidays. We started our journey early in the morning and reached by evening. The moment we arrived, I fell in love with the place—it was cold, peaceful, and surrounded by tall, beautiful mountains.

The house we stayed in had a wonderful view, with a quiet pond nearby. That evening, we went for a small walk outside. The road rose and dipped gently, and I enjoyed every moment of that simple walk with my family.

The next morning, when I woke up, the whole place was covered in thick fog, and I watched a beautiful sunrise slowly break through it. Later, we visited the bamboo forest, where my little cousins ran around happily. We also explored a botanical garden, filled with colourful flowers and calm greenery.

The entire trip felt magical, and I enjoyed every second of it.
